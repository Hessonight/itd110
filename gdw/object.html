<p><h2>All-Star</h2>
<h3>By Smash Mouth</h3>
<br>
Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me<br>
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
In the shape of an L on her forehead<br>
<br>
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
<br> 
So much to do, so much to see<br>
So what's wrong with taking the back streets<br>
You'll never know if you don't go<br>
You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
<br>
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
Hey now, you're a rockstar, get the show on, get paid<br>
All that glitters is gold<br>
Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
