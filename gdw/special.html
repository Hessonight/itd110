<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings in HTML, you can't use
these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called
"special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign 
appear in your document, you need to use &amp;lt; to represent it.
