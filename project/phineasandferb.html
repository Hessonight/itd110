<h1>Phineas and Ferb</h1>
<p>Step-brothers Phineas and Ferb spend their summer doing absurd projects with
their friends. These include making a rollercoaster, going to the moon, and time
travelling. Their older sister Candace wants to &quot;bust&quot; her brothers
by showing their mom what the boys made, but always fails. Nearly every episode
has a b-plot where the family's pet platypus,  Perry,  fights evil Dr. Heinz 
Doofenshmirtz. The show was created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot;
Marsh and aired from 2008 to 2015 on the Disney Channel.</p>
